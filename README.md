## Introduction

We check for `python` and `pip`
```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

Then we install our Naeural Edge Protocol SDK
```bash
pip install --upgrade naeural_client
```

We test the network using the `nepctl` command line interface
```bash
nepctl get nodes
```

> Starting with version 3 the `nepctl` will not require additional initial configuration as it will automatically connect and self-authenticate with the network.
> For versions 2 and below at the first run we'll be required to edit the `~/.nepctl/config` file and put in the template the credentials .
